# Select Dashboards For Your Cloud SIEM Summary Page



### Choosing a dashboard

By default, when accessing your Cloud SIEM page, you will see the **Summary** dashboard. This dashboard shows you general information on your security events. You can request Logz.io to configure the default dashboard to your needs.

Cloud SIEM includes a number of dashboards dedicated specifically to a data source you may be using.

To access a dashboard:

1. Sign in to Logz.io.

2. Go to **SIEM > Dashboards**.
