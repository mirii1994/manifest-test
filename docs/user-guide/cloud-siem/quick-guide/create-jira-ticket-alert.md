You can configure the notification endpoint to create a JIRA ticket in your preferred board, every time there is a new alert.

### Pre-requisites

* Make sure that you have permissions to create a task in the required JIRA board.

* Create an API token for your [Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/).

* Convert the API token using the following command:

  ```shell
  echo -n <YOUR-EMAIL>:<YOUR-ATLASSIAN-API-TOKEN> | base64
  ```
  Replace `<YOUR-EMAIL>` with the email for your attlassian account and `<YOUR-ATLASSIAN-API-TOKEN>` with the API token for your Atlassian account.
