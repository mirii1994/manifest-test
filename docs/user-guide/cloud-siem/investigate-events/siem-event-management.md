# Cloud SIEM Event Management



Use Cloud SIEM Event Management to monitor the events triggered by Logz.io Cloud SIEM security rules.

With a single source of truth, you have visibility into the triggered security events in your environment, to track triggered event rules, set the event status, assign an event handler, and use comments to add information, and prioritize how those issues are handled.

The events are displayed in a table: You can sort the events table by severity, status, handler, last triggering date, and the last time the event was updated or edited. You can also filter and search the events in the table, to further refine your results. 


## The Event Management table

The information that is provided for each event triggered by a Cloud SIEM rule is summarized in the table below. The retention for the Event Management table is two weeks, and the number of events you can view is bound by the number of triggered rules.  


|Event| Description| 
|---|---| 
|Event details|This information includes the title, description, and Event ID of the triggered Cloud SIEM rule |
|Severity| The triggering conditions defined in the Cloud SIEM rule for a configured event threshold and time period. The event is labeled with the severity set for the rule:   **Severe > High > Medium > Low > Info**|
|Count| The number of grouped events included in the entry |
|Status|Investigation stage of the triggered event:  **- New:** A triggered event that has not been assigned **- Assigned:** Investigation pending **- In Progress:** The assigned handler is investigating the event **- Waiting for response:** Investigation on hold pending reply from external stakeholders **- False positive:**  Investigation verified that the detected activity is benign **- Resolved:** Investigation complete |
|Assigned to| Team member handling event investigation and resolution |
|Last triggered| Date and time the rule was last triggered |
|Comment| Additional information added by investigators:  Use this field to include handling priority information and any information relevant to the investigation|
|Updated|Date of latest changes made to the event and which user made the changes|

## Editing an event

You can update the following event fields: 

- The investigation **Status** of the event.
- The investigator the event is **Assigned to**. Once an event is assigned to a team member, the assignment can't be reset to **Unassigned**. 
- Add text to the **Comment** field, to provide information about the event investigation, the handling process, or task priorities. 


After an investigator edits an event, the date and user are automatically displayed in the **Updated** field for the event.  


## Editing an event rule
