# Archive & Restore



Archiving provides a cost-effective solution for long-term storage of logs that don't need to be instantly searchable. You can configure Logz.io to archive logs to an AWS S3 bucket or a Microsoft Azure Storage account.

When you need to investigate old logs after they have expired from your account, you can restore them to a temporary account with no additional storage costs.

To get to the **Archive and restore** page, select **Data Hub > Archive and restore**.

* **Archive configuration**
: You can configure Logz.io to archive your logs to either an AWS S3 bucket or a Microsoft Azure Storage container. [Learn more](/user-guide/archive-and-restore/configure-archiving.html).

* **Restore data**
: Re-ingest up to 24 hours of archived logs. Restoring data might require additional permissions. [Learn more](/user-guide/archive-and-restore/configure-archiving.html).

* **Restored accounts**
: Data is restored to a temporary account. The list of Restored accounts includes information about who made the request and its status. [Learn more](/user-guide/archive-and-restore/restore-archived-logs.html)



## Known limitations

Each account (or sub-account) should archive to a separate S3 bucket.

The maximum amount of data that can be restored is equal to your accountâ€™s daily reserved volume and is capped at 100 GB for all accounts (including accounts with a daily reserved volume greater than 100 GB).

If the restore process exceeds this maximum, the process fails.
