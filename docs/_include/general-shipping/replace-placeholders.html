Replace the placeholders to match your specifics. (They are indicated by the double angle brackets `<< >>`):

* Replace `<<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>` with the token of the account you want to ship to.

* Replace `<<LISTENER-HOST>>` with the host [for your region](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html#available-regions). For example, `listener.logz.io` if your account is hosted on AWS US East, or `listener-nl.logz.io` if hosted on Azure West Europe. The required port depends whether HTTP or HTTPS is used: HTTP = 8070, HTTPS = 8071.
