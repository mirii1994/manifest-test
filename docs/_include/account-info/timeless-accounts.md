While your main account and sub accounts
are better suited for short-term monitoring of your log data,
they're not really a cost-effective way to view long-term patterns and trends.
That's where **timeless** accounts come in.

Timeless accounts work with optimizers,
allowing you to save a subset of your logs for as long as you need them.
You can store key metrics that you want to track in your timeless accounts.
Each timeless account contains its own Elasticsearch index,
which you can search from your main account.

If you're an admin for the main account, you can manage the main account and sub accounts from the [**Manage Accounts**](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) page (**<i class="li li-gear"></i> > Settings > Manage accounts** in the navigation menu).

### 2. Adjust account volume

If you need to adjust the **Timeless account volume**,

:::note
Your plan allows for a maximum data volume.
Keep this limit in mind when you allocate resources to your timeless accountsâ€”you won't be able to exceed the limits of your plan. \\
\\
Contact your Logz.io account manager if you need to increase your plan limits.

### 3. Set search permissions

If you want your sub accounts to be able to search this account,
add the intended accounts to the **Read & write permissions** box.

### 4. Save your changes

Click **Apply** to save your changes.
